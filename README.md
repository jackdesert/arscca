- Upgrade packaging tools.

    env/bin/pip install --upgrade pip setuptools requests bs4 redis

    env/bin/pytest

Backlog
-------

  * Make Pos Class sortable (so it's not confusing to not have it)
  * Sort by last name instead of first name
  * Ask if there are any legal issues with posting results
  * After new stats become available, post new mashup facebook @arscca
  * robots.txt
  * advertise
  * View your own source code to make sure <header>, etc are in order
  * Move content close to top
  * Advertise it!
  * Make it easy to see classes grouped together (stripe??)
  * Find canonical spelling of pax Pax PAX and spell all columns the same


  * Allow highlight a single driver (This interaction design may need
    me to observe several people using the site so I can see if they intuit
    how it works)
  * Maybe we want to be able to highlight multiple drivers?



Genuine

Let me know if you would like to link arscca to this site, or somehow integrate the two
