How to Have Fun at Autocross
============================

Some of you might ask, how could one NOT have fun at autocross.
But what I really want to highlight is the various reasons drivers compete.

Think of the drivers you know, and in you mind lump them into these categories:

Fast car | Slow car
Fast Driver | Slow Driver | Show Driver
Wise tuner | Foolish tuner


Goals
-----

Given that each driver has a different set of abilities, even if
we were all striving for the same goal, we would still stratify
into amazing, mediocre, and poor.

But consider this: Not all drivers share the same goal or motivation.

Here is a list of possible motivations, grouped into categories:


CONQUER
Wants to prove
Recognition

Win a trophy

Prove one's capability to others
Prove one's capability to self
