How to Have Fun at Autocross
============================

Some of you might ask, how could one NOT have fun at autocross.
But what I really want to highlight is the various reasons drivers compete.

Think of the drivers you know, and in you mind lump them into these categories:

Fast car | Slow car
Fast Driver | Slow Driver | Show Driver
Wise tuner | Foolish tuner


Goals
-----

Given that each driver has a different set of abilities, even if
we were all striving for the same goal, we would still stratify
into amazing, mediocre, and poor.

But consider this: Not all drivers share the same goal or motivation.

Here is a list of possible motivations:


Recognition

Demarcation
Get away from the spouse
Loves the sound of engines
Loves to go sideways
