## Create Event


AxWare is happier if you create all your events for a season in the same directory.
That way your stylesheets and class definitions are the same for the entire season.

If, on the other hand, you create a new directory for each event, it will
make a copy of the stylesheets and class definitions from whatever folder
you saved your last event in. And pretty soon you have several copies
of all these files. (And none of them are linked)

## Class Definitions

The class definitions are in the data directory with the extension .def.

It appears to be a tab-delimited text file.

To edit the base file (in the data directory), close the event you are in,
then click Edit -> Class Definitions. Then use the **Browse** button.

To edit just the file for your current event, you can leave the event open
and click Edit -> Class Definitions.
