Things to Ask For
=================

What is the RallX facebook home? Is it distinct from AutoX home?
What is the best way to send unified messaging?

How do I get the /schedule url to show up as the schedule
                 /results


Brainstorming Regarding Unified Messaging
  - for example, the carts class that was sent out as an ad-hoc email to newsletter recipients:
    - Where all should that announcement go?
      - newsletter / facebook / front page of website / calendar?
