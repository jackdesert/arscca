FAQ

Q: What is a two-driver-car?
A: Two drivers both signed up to drive the same car.
   Each driver still gets six runs, but the car will get double that.

Q: What is Codriving?
A: Say your friend has no car, but you want her to compete in the event.
   Ask if she wants to codrive with you. That means you both sign up for the
   event as separate drivers, but you both do your six runs in the same car.
   (The lucky car gets 12 runs, in this case.)
   Sometimes codrivers ride along on the other's runs to offer feedback
   or to learn more about the course and the car, or for mere companionship.
   Other times the drivers may drive solo, either to have less distractions
   or less weight in the car.
   One thing codriving is---it's the only way you'll ever really be able to
   compare your driving skills to another's.

Q: Is Superman fast, or is it just his cape?
A: In autocross, many factors are at play, each one accounting for some amount of
   time from best to worst. Here are some guesses:
   Driver skill (5 seconds).
   Tire amazingness (4 seconds).
   Car amazingness, including how well it's dialed in (3 seconds).
   Driver familiarity with the car (2 seconds).
   Luck (1 second).

Q: Should I esteem fast drivers more than slow ones?
A: That's up to you. Here's a mind bender for you.
   Instead of saying, "He beat me", try saying
   "His car beat mine." It has a different flavor.

Q: How to have FUN
A: Some folks might laugh that this is even in here, but I want to take a moment
   to point out the things I think people get out of autocross. That may give
   you some ideas of what you want to pursue within the club.
   A. Comraderie
   B. Adrenalin
   C. Competition
   D. A test bed for the tweaks on your car
   E. An audience
   F. A place to hear fun car sounds
   G. Winning
   H. Car control (useful on city streets)
   I. Running things
   J. Volunteering
   K. Spectator Entertainment

Q: How do I know if I'm getting better?
A: Each course is different, so your time alone will not tell you if you
   are improving. Faster cars generally keep track of how close they are
   to the front---either by raw time or PAX time. But if you're somewhere in the
   middle, it's harder to see where you're at. If there are a lot of people in your
   class, you can keep track of how you are doing in your class. But even if you
   don't have a popular class, you can still pick out two or three cars
   that consistently run a second or two faster than you, and you can
   work toward running faster than them in the future.








In autocross, it's more like: "Is so-and-so fast, or is it just their car?"
