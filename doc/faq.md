FAQ

Q: What is a two-driver-car?
A: A car that two different drivers are signed up in.
   Each driver still gets six runs, but the car will get double that.

Q: What is Codriving?
A: Two drivers competing in the same event using the same car.
   Say your friend has no car, but you want her to compete in the event.
   Ask if she wants to codrive with you. That means you both sign up for the
   event as separate drivers, but you both do your six runs in the same car.
   (The lucky car gets 12 runs, in this case.)
   Sometimes codrivers ride along on the other's runs to offer feedback
   or to learn more about the course and the car, or for mere companionship.
   Other times the drivers may drive solo, either to have less distractions
   or less weight in the car.
   One thing codriving is---it's the only way you'll ever really be able to
   compare your driving skills to another's.

Q: Is that driver fast, or is it just their car?
A: In autocross, many factors are at play, each one accounting for some amount of
   time from best to worst. Here are some guesses as to how much time can be
   gained by each:
   Driver skill (5 seconds).
   Tire amazingness (4 seconds).
   Car amazingness, including how well it's dialed in (3 seconds).
   Driver familiarity with the car (2 seconds).
   Luck (1 second).



Q: Should I esteem fast drivers more than slow ones?
A: That's up to you. Here's a mind bender for you:
   Instead of saying, "He beat me", try saying
   "His car beat mine." It has a different flavor, and
   helps you to remember that both car and driver matter.
   Also remember that drivers mature, and so do relationships with cars.


Q: Should I esteem the owners of fast cars more than the owners of slow ones?
Q: Should I esteem the tuners of fast cars more than the tuners of slow ones?

Q: What is a class?
A: A class is a grouping of similar cars, and each class allows certain
   performance modifications.  It gives you a *suggestion* of which other cars
   might perform as well as yours.  But the classing system is inherently imperfect.
   That is, there are still large performance differences, even among cars
   in the same class.


Q: What is PAX?
A: PAX is how much handicap your class is given.
   That is, PAX is one way of comparing performance across disparate classes.
   The PAX system is imperfect, and does NOT guarantee an even playing field.
   But the PAX playing field is at least not so
   steeply slanted as the raw scores would be.

Q: Is it safe to assume that the top 10 PAX drivers are the
   most skilled drivers?
A: If the PAX system were perfect (and the classing system, for that matter),
   then yes.


Q: How to have FUN (also see templates/blog/fun.md)
A: Some folks might laugh that this is even in here, but here is a list of things
   that may lure folks into the racing scene. That is, don't assume everyone
   is here for the same reasons.
   A. Comraderie
   B. Adrenalin
   C. Competition
   D. A test bed for the tweaks on your car
   E. An audience
   F. A place to hear fun car sounds
   G. Winning
   H. Car control (useful on city streets)
   I. Running things
   J. Volunteering
   K. Spectator Entertainment

Q: How do I know if I'm getting better?
A: Each course is different, so your time alone will not tell you if you
   are improving. Faster cars generally keep track of how close they are
   to the front---either by raw time or PAX time. But if you're somewhere in the
   middle, it's harder to see where you're at. If there are a lot of people in your
   class, you can keep track of how you are doing in your class. But even if you
   don't have a popular class, you can still pick out two or three cars
   that consistently run a second or two faster than you, and you can
   work toward running faster than them in the future.








In autocross, it's more like: "Is so-and-so fast, or is it just their car?"
