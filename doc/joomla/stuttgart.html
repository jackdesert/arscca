<p>
Please familiarize yourself with this map before
coming to Stuttgart for an event. Follow the arrows to get from the appropriate gate (see below) to paddock.

<h3>WHICH GATE</h3>
<p>
We wonâ€™t know which gate is open until the course designer shows up,
so look for a post on
<a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/arscca'>ARSCCA Forum</a>
the morning of the event  to find out which gate to enter.
</p>

<h3>FOLLOW THE ARROWS</h3>
<p>
The arrows indicate the <b>only</b> paths to and from the
event area.  DO NOT drive in any area shaded in
red.
</p>

<h3>STAY AWAY FROM THE AIRPLANES</h3>
<p>
Please stay at least 50 feet from the scrap aircraft at all times. This is imperative in order for us to keep holding events at Stuttgart. So when you're working course, taking lunch, even before and after the event---give those planes lots of girth.
</p>

<h3>BE COURTEOUS</h3>
<p>
We have been fortunate to host autocross events at Stuttgart Municipal since October 2018.
We love this venue, and we want to keep using it. That said, please help us do everything we can
to keep the site owners happy. Please respect that this is an active airport, and that all of the hangars and aircraft (including the scrap metal planes) are private- or corporate-owned. Thank you for your cooperation.
