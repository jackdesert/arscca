First find which template is active. The easiest is to view the
source for the home page and seach for "template".

Now on the admin page, on the left side click Templates.

Alternatively, first go to the Templates page, click the Styles tab and look for the Default column
and look for the one which is faintly starred.

Now go to Templates page, click Templates tab, and find the template that you are using.
