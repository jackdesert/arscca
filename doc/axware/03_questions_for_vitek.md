Questions for Vitek
===================


What does registration mode do?

Axware crashes when I click "Clear all recorded timing data"


We have someone who always registers the day of. (Mike Berry)
How do we get it to always pull his member number from the membership file?







Is the barcode KER supposed to work? It doesn't work for us.

  - test this out again and find out if the computer sees anythign









When we print a barcode for someone with no member number,
someone else's barcode is printed at the bottom of the label.
Bar code comes through unrecognized.

  - Try this: sort by member number and look for empties
  - THE GRID IS TYPABLE except the yellow values


How do we keep the registration grid from scrolling when a time is recorded?
(Sometimes we print the wrong barcode because the list shifts under us)

  - Upper grid is standings when an event is live (auto sorts)
  - You CAN click "edit", the print bar code (but don't sit on it too long)






If we are set to use member numbers, do all barcodes have to be digits only?
(We are having failures with anything with letters. AND AND no error pops up.
Silent error)

  Any combination of letters and number is acceptable
  - V

Is it OK to change someone's barcode mid-event?

  - YES

How do I reduce the number of runs for an event, AND
have the new value reflected in the html results? (No empty columns)

  - Number of Runs is NUMBER of RUNS PER DAY

  - Consolidated means move into registration grid

How do I remove the PAX score from the last column of the report?


  - Setup -> Options -> Report Options -> Print Paxed Time with total column



Is there a way to check for unique barcodes


Can we change bar codes mid-event?

  - yes!


Ask Motorsportreg to disallow two people from registering from same member number.
